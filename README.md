# Customer Care

This repository contains a simple demonstration of an automated customer complaint management workflow. The workflow is composed of modular agents as described in `agents.md`.

## Running the Example

The `main.py` script runs a mock workflow that fetches a sample complaint email, extracts data, acknowledges the customer, creates a ticket and forwards it to a support team.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This is a minimal prototype intended for demonstration purposes only.
